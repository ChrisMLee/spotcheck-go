### Docker
> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

```
docker-compose up
```
### Go
> Slices can be created with the built-in make function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays.
> The make function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array

### GraphQL: Notes
#### Fetching data at a field-level
> child fields are responsible for fetching their own data
> This code is easy to reason about
> This code is more testable
> To some, the getEvent duplication might look like a code smell. But, having code that is simple, easy to reason about, and is more testable is worth a little bit of duplication.

> Fetching data at a field-level 
* [Apollo: Fetching data with resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/essentials/data)

> The context is how you access your shared connections and fetchers in resolvers to get data.

> The context is the third argument passed to every resolver. It is useful for passing things that any resolver may need, like authentication scope, database connections, and custom fetch functions. Additionally, if you're using dataloaders to batch requests across resolvers, you can attach them to the context as well.

> As a best practice, context should be the same for all resolvers, no matter the particular query or mutation, and resolvers should never modify it. This ensures consistency across resolvers, and helps increase development velocity.

* [Apollo: Designing GraphQL Mutations](https://blog.apollographql.com/designing-graphql-mutations-e09de826ed97)
> Specific mutations that correspond to semantic user actions are more powerful than general mutations. This is because specific mutations are easier for a UI developer to write, they can be optimized by a backend developer, and only providing a specific subset of mutations makes it much harder for an attacker to exploit your API.
> Mutations should only ever have one input argument. That argument should be named input and should have a non-null unique input object type.
